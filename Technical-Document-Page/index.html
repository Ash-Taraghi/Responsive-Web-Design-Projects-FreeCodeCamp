            Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming
            language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the
            use of significant indentation. Python is dynamically-typed and
            garbage-collected.
          </p>
          <p>
            Python is a great starting programming language due to it's easy
            readable syntax and high usuability.

            Python was first made in Febuary 20 of 1991, about 31 years ago. The
            language was designed by the dutch programmer Guido Van Rossum. It
            is available on Windows, macOS, Linux/UNIX, as well as andorid
            systems.

            This webpage will discuss the basics of python, yet there are many
            extensions availbale to python. Modules such as pyGame and many
            other imports can be utilized in order to acheive the desired
            program. Python does support Object Oreinted Programming as is
            fairly easy to design classes in.

          <p>
            Variables in python do not require a command to declare them.
            Varaibles are created through assignment statements in python. For
            example: "x = 5" creates a integer variable x with the value of 5.
            Variables also do not require a particular type as python determines
            this when they are assigned and can even have their type changed
            after they are assigned.
          </p>
          <p>
            To cast in python, you simply put the type you would like to
            tranform the variale to around brackets. For example, using the
            above sceanrio we would take "str(x)" to turn x into a string. You
            can also get the type of the variable using the type(variable name)
            function
          </p>
          <code
            >x = 250 <br />
            x="hello world"

          <p>
            There are 2 types of scope to discuss in pyton, which is local and
            global scopes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Local scopes are automatically given to variables declared within a
            function as that variable exists only in that function to the
            program. Global variables are either declared outside of the
            function or you can use the "global" keyword when assinging a new
            variable in a function to force that variable to have a global scope
            even though it is assinged in a local enviroment.
          </p>

          <p>
            Functions are blocks of code that only execute when they are called.
            You can pass data amongst functions known as parameters, into the
            function. Functions have the ability to return data as their result.
          </p>
          <p>
            In python, functions are declared using the def keyword and all the
            code inside the function must be indented. Parameters being passed
            in must be declared in the brackets of the function and if the
            function is supposed to return a value a return statement is
            required.
          </p>

            >def sum (a , b): <br />
            # function for getting sum of two int variables a and b</code
